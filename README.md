# Victory Animation Test
A simple victory animation test to demonstrate Victory Chart's animations and transitions. Victory's documentation was adequate but I still had to do some tinkering to get certain things to work. Hopefully this might help someone.

Created using Victory, React, jQuery, JavaScript.

## Getting Started
Clone down the repo, run an `npm install` to install dependencies, and then use `npm start` to run the webpack server. The server will run at `localhost:8080`.
